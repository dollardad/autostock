AutoStock is a Plugin for car dealers, or developers/designers that build websites for clients that host car dealer websites.

== Description ==

AutoStock is "Work-in-progress" for websites that are used for car dealers. I plan on adding additional functionality
that allows for motorcycles, caravans, motor-homes and boats shortly.

This plugin creates custom content types for motor vehicle with taxonomies for makes, models and features. Note that your
hosting server must be running minimum of PHP 5.3.6 as the code includes namespaces.

This plugin is still under development but the stable version is safe to use on a production site.

***** NOTICE ******

However you should note
that this plugin will change dramatically over the next few weeks and some functions will change, therefore it is better
not to use this on a production site until I remove this Notice.


Please contact me directly for additional features ie "wish list".

Latest builds ( unstable ) can be taken from my github account dollardad->autostock

== Installation ==


1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit your settings/permalinks and reload if the new custom post type is not displaying.
